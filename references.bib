abstract="Physically the human eye is an electrical dipole. It has a negative pole at the fundus and a positive pole at the cornea. These two loads are separated by the diameter of the eye which is constant. The characteristic properties of such a dipole are the amount of the loads and the distance between them. The adequate description of a dipole is the dipole moment, which is the product of the loads and the separating distance. This ocular dipole causes an electric field which includes the surrounding tissues. The strength at the field is proportional to the dipole moment. If we compare the electrical effects of identical eye movements on a recorder for electro-nystagmography, we get an analogue function of this dipole (indirectly). Consequently, we speak of the ocular dipole moment (ODM). We prefer this expression because it is more exact then others used (Bestandpotential, Standing potential, Corneoretinal potential).",
